# AccessControl SQLite Project

A comprehensive access control database system for multi-location organizations, built with SQLite and designed for enterprise-level security management.

## üîê Overview

This project implements a robust access control database that manages employee access across multiple physical locations and security zones. The system tracks employee badge usage, manages access permissions by department and location, and provides detailed audit trails for security compliance.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Database Schema
The system uses a normalized SQLite database with the following core entities:

- **Departments**: Organizational units with specific access requirements
- **Locations**: Physical sites requiring access control
- **Readers**: Access control devices at entry points
- **Access Profiles**: Security clearance levels and permissions
- **Employee Profiles**: Staff information and badge data
- **Swipe Events**: Real-time access attempt logging

### Key Relationships
- Many-to-many relationship between access profiles and readers
- Department-location-access rule mapping
- Employee access inheritance through organizational rules
- Complete audit trail through swipe event tracking

## üìä Database Design

![ER Diagram](diagram.png)

The database implements a sophisticated access control model with:
- **Junction Tables**: Managing complex many-to-many relationships
- **Composite Keys**: Ensuring data integrity across related entities
- **Cascade Constraints**: Maintaining referential integrity
- **Check Constraints**: Enforcing business rules at the database level

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- SQLite 3.x
- SQL client (DB Browser for SQLite, DBeaver, or similar)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gooliverani/AccessControl-SQLite_Project.git
cd AccessControl-SQLite_Project
```

2. Open the database:
```bash
sqlite3 access_control.db
```

3. Explore the schema:
```sql
.schema
.tables
```

### Quick Start
```sql
-- View all active employees and their access profiles
SELECT * FROM current_employee_access;

-- Check recent swipe activity
SELECT 
    ep.comp_id,
    ep.first_name || ' ' || ep.last_name as employee_name,
    r.name as reader_name,
    l.name as location,
    datetime(s.swipe_time) as swipe_time,
    CASE s.access_granted 
        WHEN 1 THEN 'GRANTED' 
        ELSE 'DENIED' 
    END as access_status
FROM swipes s
JOIN employee_profiles ep ON s.employee_id = ep.id
JOIN readers r ON s.reader_id = r.id
JOIN locations l ON r.location_id = l.id
ORDER BY s.swipe_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## üîç Key Queries and Reports

### Employee Access Audit
```sql
-- Get comprehensive employee access report
SELECT * FROM current_employee_access 
WHERE total_access_profiles > 0
ORDER BY department, employee_name;
```

### Security Monitoring
```sql
-- Find employees with failed access attempts
SELECT DISTINCT
    ep.comp_id,
    ep.first_name || ' ' || ep.last_name as employee_name,
    COUNT(*) as failed_attempts
FROM swipes s
JOIN employee_profiles ep ON s.employee_id = ep.id
WHERE s.access_granted = 0
  AND date(s.swipe_time) = date('now')
GROUP BY ep.id, ep.comp_id, employee_name
HAVING failed_attempts > 3;
```

### Access Pattern Analysis
```sql
-- Analyze peak access times by location
SELECT 
    l.name as location,
    strftime('%H', s.swipe_time) as hour,
    COUNT(*) as swipe_count
FROM swipes s
JOIN readers r ON s.reader_id = r.id
JOIN locations l ON r.location_id = l.id
WHERE date(s.swipe_time) >= date('now', '-7 days')
GROUP BY l.name, hour
ORDER BY l.name, hour;
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Database Optimizations

### Indexes
- **Composite Indexes**: Optimized multi-column queries for readers and access profiles
- **Performance Indexes**: Fast employee expiration checks and swipe analysis
- **Foreign Key Indexes**: Accelerated join operations

### Triggers
- **Company ID Validation**: Enforces naming convention (FirstInitial + LastInitial + 6 digits)
- **Automatic Access Assignment**: Auto-assigns permissions based on department/location rules
- **Name Change Handling**: Updates company IDs when employee names change

### Views
- **current_employee_access**: Real-time employee access summary for audits
- **Materialized Patterns**: Cached complex joins for frequent security reviews

## üìà Use Cases

### Security Administration
- **Employee Onboarding**: Automated access profile assignment
- **Access Reviews**: Regular certification of employee permissions
- **Incident Investigation**: Detailed audit trails for security events
- **Compliance Reporting**: Ready-made views for regulatory requirements

### Facility Management
- **Reader Configuration**: Manage access control devices across locations
- **Zone Management**: Define and modify security zones and clearance levels
- **Capacity Planning**: Analyze facility usage patterns

### HR Integration
- **Badge Management**: Track employee badge lifecycle and expiration
- **Department Transfers**: Automatic access profile updates
- **Contractor Management**: Temporary access with expiration dates

## üöß Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
- **Fixed Locations**: Hardcoded location list requires schema changes for new sites
- **Single Location Assignment**: Employees limited to one primary location
- **Basic Audit Trail**: Limited historical tracking of access rule changes
- **No Hierarchical Structures**: Flat location model without building/floor support

### Planned Enhancements
- **Cloud IAM Integration**: Microsoft Entra ID and Workday HCM connectivity
- **Role-Based Database Access**: Enhanced security with MySQL/PostgreSQL migration
- **Badge Printing Integration**: Automated badge production workflow
- **Advanced Analytics**: Machine learning for anomaly detection
- **Mobile API**: REST API for mobile access management apps
