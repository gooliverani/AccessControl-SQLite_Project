# AccessControl SQLite Project

A comprehensive access control database system for multi-location organizations, built with SQLite and designed for enterprise-level security management.

## üîê Overview

This project implements a robust access control database that manages employee access across multiple physical locations and security zones. The system tracks employee badge usage, manages access permissions by department and location, and provides detailed audit trails for security compliance.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Database Schema
The system uses a normalized SQLite database with the following core entities:

- **Departments**: Organizational units with specific access requirements
- **Locations**: Physical sites requiring access control
- **Readers**: Access control devices at entry points
- **Access Profiles**: Security clearance levels and permissions
- **Employee Profiles**: Staff information and badge data
- **Swipe Events**: Real-time access attempt logging

### Key Relationships
- Many-to-many relationship between access profiles and readers
- Department-location-access rule mapping
- Employee access inheritance through organizational rules
- Complete audit trail through swipe event tracking

## üìä Database Design

![ER Diagram](diagram.png)

The database implements a sophisticated access control model with:
- **Junction Tables**: Managing complex many-to-many relationships
- **Composite Keys**: Ensuring data integrity across related entities
- **Cascade Constraints**: Maintaining referential integrity
- **Check Constraints**: Enforcing business rules at the database level

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- SQLite 3.x
- SQL client (DB Browser for SQLite, DBeaver, or similar)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gooliverani/AccessControl-SQLite_Project.git
cd AccessControl-SQLite_Project
```

2. Open the database:
```bash
sqlite3 access_control.db
```

3. Explore the schema:
```sql
.schema
.tables
```

### Quick Start
```sql
-- View all active employees and their access profiles
SELECT * FROM current_employee_access;

-- Check recent swipe activity
SELECT 
    "employee_profiles"."comp_id",
    "employee_profiles"."first_name" || ' ' || "employee_profiles"."last_name" AS "employee_name",
    "readers"."name" AS "reader_name",
    "locations"."name" AS "location",
    datetime("swipes"."swipe_time") AS "swipe_time",
    CASE "swipes"."access_granted" 
        WHEN 1 THEN 'GRANTED' 
        ELSE 'DENIED' 
    END AS "access_status"
FROM "swipes"
JOIN "employee_profiles" ON "swipes"."employee_id" = "employee_profiles"."id"
JOIN "readers" ON "swipes"."reader_id" = "readers"."id"
JOIN "locations" ON "readers"."location_id" = "locations"."id"
ORDER BY "swipes"."swipe_time" DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## üîç Key Queries and Reports

### Employee Access Overview
```sql
-- View all active employees and their access profiles
SELECT * FROM current_employee_access;

-- List employees by department
SELECT 
    "departments"."name" AS "department",
    "employee_profiles"."comp_id",
    "employee_profiles"."first_name" || ' ' || "employee_profiles"."last_name" AS "employee_name",
    "locations"."name" AS "location"
FROM "employee_profiles"
JOIN "departments" ON "employee_profiles"."department_id" = "departments"."id"
JOIN "locations" ON "employee_profiles"."location_id" = "locations"."id"
WHERE "employee_profiles"."expire_date" > CAST(strftime('%Y%m%d', 'now') AS INTEGER)
ORDER BY "departments"."name", "employee_profiles"."last_name";
```

### Access Control Monitoring
```sql
-- Recent access attempts (last 24 hours)
SELECT 
    "employee_profiles"."comp_id",
    "employee_profiles"."first_name" || ' ' || "employee_profiles"."last_name" AS "employee_name",
    "readers"."name" AS "reader",
    "locations"."name" AS "location",
    "swipes"."swipe_time",
    CASE "swipes"."access_granted" WHEN 1 THEN 'GRANTED' ELSE 'DENIED' END AS "result"
FROM "swipes"
JOIN "employee_profiles" ON "swipes"."employee_id" = "employee_profiles"."id"
JOIN "readers" ON "swipes"."reader_id" = "readers"."id"
JOIN "locations" ON "readers"."location_id" = "locations"."id"
WHERE "swipes"."swipe_time" >= datetime('now', '-1 day')
ORDER BY "swipes"."swipe_time" DESC;

-- Failed access attempts today
SELECT 
    "employee_profiles"."comp_id",
    "employee_profiles"."first_name" || ' ' || "employee_profiles"."last_name" AS "employee_name",
    "readers"."name" AS "reader",
    COUNT(*) AS "failed_attempts"
FROM "swipes"
JOIN "employee_profiles" ON "swipes"."employee_id" = "employee_profiles"."id"
JOIN "readers" ON "swipes"."reader_id" = "readers"."id"
WHERE "swipes"."access_granted" = 0 
  AND date("swipes"."swipe_time") = date('now')
GROUP BY "employee_profiles"."id", "readers"."id"
ORDER BY "failed_attempts" DESC;
```

### Advanced Reports

#### Individual Employee Audit (from comp_id_audit.sql)
For detailed audit of specific employee (e.g., 'JS100004') - see `comp_id_audit.sql` for complete query

#### Attendance Analysis (from first_last_swipe.sql)  
For shift analysis and working hours calculation - see `first_last_swipe.sql` for complete query

### Administrative Queries
```sql
-- List all readers by location
SELECT 
    "locations"."name" AS "location",
    "readers"."name" AS "reader_name"
FROM "readers"
JOIN "locations" ON "readers"."location_id" = "locations"."id"
ORDER BY "locations"."name", "readers"."name";

-- Access profiles and their assigned readers
SELECT 
    "access"."name" AS "access_profile",
    "locations"."name" AS "location",
    GROUP_CONCAT("readers"."name", ', ') AS "readers"
FROM "access"
JOIN "access_readers" ON "access"."id" = "access_readers"."access_id"
JOIN "readers" ON "access_readers"."reader_id" = "readers"."id"

## üõ†Ô∏è Database Optimizations

### Indexes
- **Composite Indexes**: Optimized multi-column queries for readers and access profiles
- **Performance Indexes**: Fast employee expiration checks and swipe analysis
- **Foreign Key Indexes**: Accelerated join operations

### Triggers
- **Company ID Validation**: Enforces naming convention (FirstInitial + LastInitial + 6 digits)
- **Automatic Access Assignment**: Auto-assigns permissions based on department/location rules
- **Name Change Handling**: Updates company IDs when employee names change

### Views
- **current_employee_access**: Real-time employee access summary for audits
- **Materialized Patterns**: Cached complex joins for frequent security reviews

## üìà Use Cases

### Security Administration
- **Employee Onboarding**: Automated access profile assignment
- **Access Reviews**: Regular certification of employee permissions
- **Incident Investigation**: Detailed audit trails for security events
- **Compliance Reporting**: Ready-made views for regulatory requirements

### Facility Management
- **Reader Configuration**: Manage access control devices across locations
- **Zone Management**: Define and modify security zones and clearance levels
- **Capacity Planning**: Analyze facility usage patterns

### HR Integration

- **Contractor Management**: Temporary access with expiration dates

## üöß Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
- **Fixed Locations**: Hardcoded location list requires schema changes for new sites
- **Single Location Assignment**: Employees limited to one primary location
- **Basic Audit Trail**: Limited historical tracking of access rule changes
- **No Hierarchical Structures**: Flat location model without building/floor support

### Planned Enhancements
- **Cloud IAM Integration**: Microsoft Entra ID and Workday HCM connectivity
- **Role-Based Database Access**: Enhanced security with MySQL/PostgreSQL migration
- **Badge Printing Integration**: Automated badge production workflow
- **Advanced Analytics**: Machine learning for anomaly detection
- **Mobile API**: REST API for mobile access management apps
